\chapter{Future Work}

Because it's hard to modify the system behavior when mirroring, we intend to build a proxy-based sanitizing server which detects whether sensitive information is shown on the mirroring content. If there is sensitive information on the screen, the sanitizing server filter out all private data and system feedbacks which might cause credential leakage.

Also, we would like to know whether users aware the information leakage over mirroring stream. We want to setup an  psychological experiments to evaluate the mental model of users and to know how do users feel when they did sensitive action in screen mirroring, e.g., type password, display private data like telephone or address on screen.
