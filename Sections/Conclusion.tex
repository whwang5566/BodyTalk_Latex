\chapter{Conclusion}

Our 12-person study with three popular online co-operative games showed that language barrier significantly degraded players' experience. 
We proposed and developed a platform, called BodyTalk, to explore how body language communication affects 
co-operative experiences. It used Kinect sensors to track usersâ€™ postures and shared them as avatars in real-time over the Internet, and uses Wii remotes to navigate the avatars. 

Our 48-person user study using our prototype game built on BodyTalk showed that adding body language to cooperative experience made it more fun and less frustrating, and improved the co-experience for all participants, especially for those without common languages. Also, 79\% of the participants preferred having body language communication.

In addition to exploring improved sensors to better support non-verbal communication, we also plan to explore how body language affects other types of co-operative experiences.
