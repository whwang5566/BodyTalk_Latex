\chapter{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented an investigation of the current state of screen mirroring on mobile devices and proposed a new security threat about intercepting the mirroring stream. The attacker could be able to retrieve the plaintext password from the mirroring stream. Also, capturing the unlock PIN code, and even breaking the two-step SMS verification are also possible. To proof the existence of the threat, we have built a tool which automatically retrieve App Store password from AirPlay Mirroring stream. The result of our  proof of concept demonstration is ... [è£œ].

We discussed possible method that could alleviate the problem. The solutions we proposed are including OS solution, sanitized proxy solution, and physical access to establish mirroring connection. Our finding also suggest several area of future work. We would like to know whether normal users aware the information leakage over mirroring stream and study the mental model about users. Moreover, we intend to build a proxy-based sanitizing system to sanitize the mirroring stream and prevent credential leakage.
